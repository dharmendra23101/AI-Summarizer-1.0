   - Adjustable summary length (Brief, Medium, Detailed)
   - Different styles (Standard, Bullet Points, Academic, Simple)
   - Optional glossary generation for key terms

3. **Area Selection Tool**
   - Allows users to select specific sections of a webpage
   - Perfect for focusing on relevant content only
   - Interactive visual selection interface

4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Intuitive, modern UI with responsive design
   - Dark/light theme support

   - Developed user interface components

4. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Tested on various websites and content types
   - Optimized performance and reduced load times
   - Improved accuracy of summaries through prompt engineering

5. **Refinement**
   - Added additional features like dark mode and glossary generation
   - Enhanced user experience based on testing feedback
   - Optimized memory usage and API calls

## DEMONSTRATION WALKTHROUGH

1. **Installation & Setup**
   - Loading the extension
   - Configuring the API key
   - Setting preferences

2. **Basic Summarization**
   - Navigating to a webpage
   - Generating a full-page summary
   - Customizing output (language, length, style)

3. **Area Selection**
   - Using the selection tool to highlight specific content
   - Generating a summary of just the selected area
   - Comparing to full-page summary

4. **Saving & Exporting**
   - Saving summaries for later reference
   - Viewing saved summaries
   - Exporting to a dedicated view
